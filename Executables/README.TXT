Thank you for installing AtmosphereOS v0.1.0!
We recommend you take a look in our Atmosphere desktop folder.
Atmosphere focuses on cutting the crap out of your operating system.
Our goals are:
    Privacy
    Performance
    Stability
    Ui/Usability
    And being user-friendly
Atmosphere is still in beta and many changes are bound to happen
We hope you enjoy your time on Atmosphere11 v0.1.0! (I know the naming is inconsistent but we're working on it ok?)
<3 Atmosphere Team and Goldendraggon
