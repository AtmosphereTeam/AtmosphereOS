# AtmosphereOS
**AtmosphereOS** is a Windows 11 \ 10 AME Wizard playbook aimed at improving many Windows aspects.<br>
While based on **AtlasOS**, AtmosphereOS takes a more modular approach â€” giving users the ability to customize more deeply based on their needs and preferences.

## AtmosphereOS goals
 - Privacy
 - Performance
 - Ui/Usability
 - And being user-friendly

## Our target audience
 - Gamers
 - Power users
 - Low-end system users

## ðŸš§ Current Development Direction

We want Atmosphere to combine the best aspects of major playbooks like **AME11**, **AtlasOS**, and **ReviOS**.  
To achieve this, Atmosphere will offer **highly customizable install options**, including:

- **App removal options** â€“ choose which apps to remove (useful for keeping apps others might use)
- **UI modifications** â€“ customize the start menu and shell (not everyone likes Fluent Metro)
- **Software installation** â€“ pick a browser and access recommended software links in the Atmosphere Desktop folder
- **Windows components** â€“ disable features like Windows Update, Defender, and more
- **Advanced mode (soonâ„¢)** â€“ full control: remove system components, Amelioration (to a degree), and other powerful tools<br>

*Advanced mode might be implemented in parts, not all at once. A tool similar to the Revision Tool is also being considered, but nothing is guaranteed.*
